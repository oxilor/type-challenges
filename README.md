# Collection of TypeScript type challenges with solutions

Uncompleted challenges:
1. 00697-extreme-tag
1. 00869-extreme-distributeunions
1. 00925-extreme-assert-array-index
1. 06228-extreme-json-parser

The following completed challenges turned out to be the most difficult for me, and I can't solve them without hints:
- 00898-easy-includes (struggled with detecting the difference between `{ readonly a: 'A' }` and `{ a: 'A' }`)
- 00020-medium-promise-all (struggled with test cases 3-4)
- 02257-medium-minusone (a little hint on how to convert a string to a number)
- 00553-hard-deep-object-to-unique (I was so close to the solution that I regret that I didn't solve it myself [:(])
- 00730-hard-union-to-tuple (struggled with picking only one item from an union)

The rest was solved without hints and googling (`138` out of `147`). It took 5 days. Only me and lovely TypeScript.

See the [original repository](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges) for more information about these challenges.
